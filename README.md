word-generator
==============

A simple package that generates random and (probably) meaningless words, but respecting the linguistic rules of each language.

This project is intended to be a random word generator, respecting the according language rules. In this first moment, I'll work on developing brazilian portuguese words, without accentuation. In the future, accentuation may be added or the support for other languages.
